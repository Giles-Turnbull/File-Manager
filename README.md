<h1>File-Manager</h1>
This a Python file which uses the library watchdog to monitor file downloads. When a file is downloaded it is moved to the corresponding directory dependent on the file type. This is a quick and easy piece of code used for file management and productivity. I was annoyed when doing data analytics having to constantly go to the downloads folder so decided to create this.
